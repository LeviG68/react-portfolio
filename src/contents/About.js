                I started my journey in the world of web development in college. Working with HTML and JavaScript, getting a degree in Management and Marketing. In 2018, I decided to go back to school and enter into a <b>Full stack</b> Web Development Boot camp learning the <b>MERN</b> stack. Now I like to center my interests in Web Development, I like to create interactive UI components for better designs and use the latest in front-end web technology to show my abilities. I enjoy working with React, JavaScript, jQuery and CSS to demonstrate my skills.
