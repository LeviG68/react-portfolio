                I started my journey in the world of web development in college. Working with HTML and JavaScript, getting a degree in Management and Marketing. Then in 2018 I decided to go back to school and enter into a Full stack Web Development Boot camp learning the <b>MERN</b> stack. Now I like to center my intrests in Web Development, I like to create interactive UI components for better UX and use the latest in front-end web technology to display my creativities. I like working with React, JavaScript, Jquery and CSS to show my creatvities.
